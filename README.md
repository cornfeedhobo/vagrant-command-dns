VagrantPlugins::CommandDns
==========================

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-command-dns.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-command-dns)

Todo:
- add confirm to destroy subcommands
- add windows support
- add guest /etc/hosts editing
- add dns server option


## Motivation
- Hostsupdater does not have an enable/disable option
- Hostsupdater requires that a Vagrantfile specify a static address
- External DNS support should not be tied to the vagrant provider
- Action hooks are a poor way to manage DNS


## Goals
- Create a plugin that can incorporate all other existing DNS plugins
- ?
- Profit!


## Is it any good?
[Yes](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)


# Installation
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-command-dns
```


# Configuration
- [optional] `aliases` List of FQDNs to register this box's ip with
- [optional] `route53_version` The version of the AWS api to use
- [optional] `route53_access_key_id` The access key ID for accessing AWS
- [optional] `route53_secret_access_key` The secret access key for accessing AWS
- [optional] `route53_session_token` The token associated with the key for accessing AWS
- [optional] `route53_zone_id` The Route53 Zone ID


# Usage
```
vagrant dns
Usage: vagrant dns <subcommand>

Available subcommands:
     host
     ip
     route53

For help on any individual subcommand run `vagrant dns <subcommand> -h`
```


## Hostname and Aliases
The hostname and any aliases will be used to create records
```
config.vm.hostname = "www.example.com"
config.route53.aliases = ["alias.example.com", "alias2.example.com"]
```


## Network
This plugin works only for `:private_network` and `:public_network`.
```
config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "172.18.7.1"
```

or

```
config.vm.network :public_network
```


## Box Providers
Currently only VirtualBox is supported, because that is what I have to test with.

Pull requests are welcome.


## DNS Providers
Currently only editing the host's (linux/osx) `/etc/hosts` file and AWS Route53 are supported.

Pull requests are welcome.


# Route53

        }
    ]
}
```


# FAQ
Q) I reloaded my box and the `dns` command is only returning the VirtualBox NAT interface.
A) Run reload once more. This is a known issue with no workaround at the moment.


# Shortfalls
- Untested in multi-machine environments
- Does not support Windows hosts or guests
